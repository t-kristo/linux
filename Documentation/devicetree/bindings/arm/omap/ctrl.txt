OMAP Control Module bindings

Control Module contains miscellaneous features under it based on SoC type.
Pincontrol is one common feature, and typically some clock nodes are also
under control module. Syscon is used to share register level access to
drivers external to control module driver itself.

See [1] for documentation about clock/clockdomain nodes.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Must be one of:
		"ti,am3-scrm"
		"ti,am4-scrm"
		"ti,omap2-scrm"
		"ti,omap3-scrm"
		"ti,omap4-ctrl-gen-core"
		"ti,omap4-ctrl-pad-core"
- reg:		Contains Control Module register address range
		(base address and length)

Optional properties:
- clocks:	clocks for this module
- clockdomains:	clockdomains for this module

Examples:

scrm: scrm@48002000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap3-scrm", "syscon";
	reg = <0x48002000 0x1000>;

	scrm_clocks: clocks {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};

	scrm_clockdomains: clockdomains {
	};
}

&scrm_clocks {
	mcbsp5_mux_fck: mcbsp5_mux_fck {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,composite-mux-clock";
		clocks = <&core_96m_fck>, <&mcbsp_clks>;
		ti,bit-shift = <4>;
		reg = <0x02d8>;
	};
};

ctrl_gen_core: ctrl_gen_core@4a002000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-ctrl-gen-core", "syscon";
	reg = <0x4a002000 0x1000>;
};
