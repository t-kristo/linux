Texas Instruments TI-SCI Generic Power Domain
---------------------------------------------

Some TI SoCs contain a system controller (like the PMMC, etc...) that is
responsible for controlling the state of the IPs that are present.
Communication between the host processor running an OS and the system
controller happens through a protocol known as TI-SCI [1]. This pm domain
implementation plugs into the generic pm domain framework and makes use of
the TI SCI protocol power on and off each device when needed.

PM Domain Node
==============
The PM domain node represents the global PM domain managed by the PMMC,
which in this case is the single implementation as documented by the generic
PM domain bindings in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible: should be "ti,sci-pm-domain"
- #power-domain-cells: Must be 0.
- ti,sci: Phandle to the TI SCI device to use for managing the devices.

Example:
--------------------
k2g_pds: k2g_pds {
        compatible = "ti,sci-pm-domain";
        #power-domain-cells = <0>;
        ti,sci = <&pmmc>;
};

PM Domain Consumers
===================
Hardware blocks that require SCI control over their state must provide
a reference to the sci-pm-domain they are part of and a unique device
specific ID that identifies the device.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- power-domains: phandle pointing to the corresponding PM domain node.
- ti,sci-id: index representing the device id to be passed oevr SCI to
	     be used for device control.

See dt-bindings/genpd/k2g.h for the list of valid identifiers for k2g.

Example:
--------------------
uart0: serial@02530c00 {
	compatible = "ns16550a";
	...
	power-domains = <&k2g_pds>;
	ti,sci-id = <K2G_DEV_UART0>;
};
