Binding for Texas Instruments module clock.

Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. This clock is
quite much similar to the basic gate-clock [2], however, internally
it controls an OMAP module clock, which effectively handles
both interface and functional clocks for a single module. In some
cases, support for mux clock [3] is composited to the same clock node,
currently only needed for proper support of timer module clocks.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of:
  "ti,omap4-mod-clock" - basic module clock, no gating supported
  "ti,omap4-hw-mod-clock" - module clock with hardware gating support
  "ti,omap4-sw-mod-clock" - module clock with software forced gating support
  "ti,omap4-sw-no-idlest-mod-clock" - module clock with software forced gating
				      support, misses idlest
  "ti,omap4-mux-mod-clock" - composite clock with mux and module clocks, no
			     gating supported
  "ti,omap4-hw-mux-mod-clock" - composite clock with mux and module clocks,
				with hardware gating
  "ti,omap4-sw-mux-mod-clock" - composite clock with mux and module clocks,
				with software forced gating

- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0
- clocks : link to phandle of parent clock(s)
- reg : offset for register controlling adjustable gate and optional mux

Optional properties:
- ti,bit-shift : bit shift for programming the clock mux, only needed for
		 the nodes of the mux variant

Examples:
	timer6_mod_ck: timer6_mod_ck {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,omap4-sw-mux-mod-clock";
		reg = <0x0570>;
		clocks = <&syc_clk_div_ck>, <&sys_32k_ck>;
		ti,bit-shift = <24>;
	};

	i2c1_mod_ck: i2c1_mod_ck {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,omap4-sw-mod-clock";
		reg = <0x14a0>;
		clocks = <&func_96m_fclk>;
	};

	hsi_mod_ck: hsi_mod_ck {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,omap4-hw-mod-clock";
		reg = <0x1338>;
		clocks = <&hsi_fck>;
	};
