Binding for TI mux-gate clock.

Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. It assumes a
register-mapped composite clock with multiple different sub-types;

a multiplexer clock with multiple input clock signals or parents, one
of which can be selected as output, this behaves exactly as [2]

an adjustable clock rate divider, this behaves exactly as [3]

a gating function which can be used to enable and disable the output
clock, this behaves exactly as [4]

The binding must provide the register mapping to control the mux-gate.
"reg-names" property is used to specify which sub-function are used
for this composite clock, and to specify the corresponding control
register addresses. Optional parameters are specified according to
the sub-types used.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of:
  "ti,mux-gate-clock" : mux-gate clock which waits until clock is active
			before returning from clk_enable()
  "ti,no-wait-mux-gate-clock" : mux-gate clock which does not wait for
				clock activity
  "ti,interface-mux-gate-clock" : mux-gate interface clock which waits until
				  clock is active before returning from
				  clk_enable()
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks : link phandles of parent clocks
- reg : base address array for registers controlling the mux-gate
  sub-functions. Ordered according to "reg-names" property.
- reg-names : register names property, can have following values:
	"gate-reg" : base address for gate function control register
	"mux-reg" : base address for mux function control register
	"div-reg" : base address for divider function control register
  Any of these values can be left out, and the corresponding function
  will not be present in the composite clock either.

Optional properties:
- ti,gate-bit-shift : number of bits to shift the enable bit for gating
  function, defaults to 0 if not present
- ti,mux-bit-shift : number of bits to shift the bit-field for mux
  function, defaults to 0 if not present
- ti,div-index-starts-at-one : min-div is mapped to bit-value 1, default 0
- ti,max-div : maximum divider value for the divider function
- ti,min-div : minimum divider value for the divider function, defaults to
  1 if not present
- ti,dividers : array of valid divider values for the clock
