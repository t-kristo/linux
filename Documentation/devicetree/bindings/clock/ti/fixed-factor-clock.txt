Binding for TI fixed factor rate clock sources.

Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "ti,fixed-factor-clock".
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- ti,clock-div: fixed divider.
- ti,clock-mult: fixed multiplier.
- clocks: parent clock.

Optional properties:
- ti,autoidle-shift: bit shift of the autoidle enable bit for the clock
- reg: base address for the autoidle register of this clock
- ti,autoidle-low: autoidle is enabled by setting the bit to 0
- ti,set-rate-parent: clk_set_rate is propagated to parent

Example:
	clock {
		compatible = "ti,fixed-factor-clock";
		clocks = <&parentclk>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		ti,clock-div = <2>;
		ti,clock-mult = <1>;
	};
